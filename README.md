`Predicting future meteorite finds in Gosport, UK, using NASA meteorite data and a multi-agent optimizer (UMACO)`

## Gosport Meteorite Hotspot Simulation with UMACO

Simulates 1000+ years of potential meteorite falls in the Gosport, UK region
using historical meteorite find data and the Universal Multi-Agent Cognitive Optimization (UMACO) framework.

---

### The script:
- Loads worldwide or UK-specific meteorite finds from a NASA dataset (CSV)
- Builds a local grid map of the Gosport area
- Uses the UMACO optimizer to simulate and identify statistically promising search zones for undiscovered meteorites
- Outputs a heatmap or "treasure map" for meteorite hunting in the Gosport region

---

Perfect for amateur and professional meteorite hunters, or anyone interested in citizen science,
local geodata, and optimization techniques for rare-object discovery.
